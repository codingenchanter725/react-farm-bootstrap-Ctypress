- add page random values button isnt working. posting to same page but init not running again.
- add page new values button necessary?  
- test harvest. could have issue since name attributes changed lines         
- (job posted) mobile view of report table has page size, paging, and item count display smashed together 
- harvest testing should run both generated tests and original tests of farm 
- (job posted) validation error on register is expanding the width of the card. validation message is too long and does not wrap
- allow bookmark of report page url to view page with same filters
- allow bookmark of authorized page. require login then redirect to it.
- use /init in api url for init of page, instead of put
 

jobs... 

2. export button to csv (api should return a file?)

3. processing animaiton...
3.1. (job submitted) plant list page overlay and processing animation on result table during initial api request on init of page and search button click 

3.3 (job submitted) add plant page - show overlay and processing animation on card during initial api request on init of page

4. recommendations

5. >>>Simple Cypress implementation. 
    1 test suite on each page. no intercept of api requests. from login page, go to target page. test for existance of title. at start of spec, if target page requires authorization, register a user. Use that user in spec. Would like to use the page object pattern (each page having an object in supprot folder that exposes functions that return specific items on the page.  Example getTitle())
- (job posted) login
- (job posted) register
- (job posted) dashboard
- plant list
- add plant
- plant detail
- update plant

6. unit testing...

6.1 fix warnings and errors on existing unit tests

6.2 audit unit testing - plant list page

6.3 audit unit testing - add plant page

6.4 add missing unit testing


7. >>>visualization - line chart...
Create a new page.  Copy land-plant-list page to create land-plant-line-chart.  Replace result table with a chart that uses 'Some Date Time Val' and 'Some Decimal Val' values as data. 
Horizontal axis... datetime is horizontal axis. Dispaly dates on axis label (not time). labels for individual days should be shown on the axis, even if no data exists on that day
Vertical axis should show integers as labels. 

8. >>>visualization - card view...
create new page. Copy land-plant-list page to create land-plant-card-list. Replace result table with a card display.  Card will use 'Some Var Char Val' column as the card title and 'Some text Val' colummn as the card body. 

9. visualization - folder view

10. fix npm dependency alerts and warnings 



style changes...   
Custom validation controls need same style as bootstrap Val error

special lists...
report
objwfs
all pages 
subsets of any array. try setting each boolean prop to true or false in the dimension phrase to see if a perfect set is found. need to look for full lists first. 
  
  
Check success add navigation on result code 



Translator… 
CHANGE REPO names from r18 b5 to react18_bootstrap5


if a genval variable is in the genif statement, you can remove it from the dimensional phrase?

instead of putting all booleans in the dimension phrase, use wildcard 'is*=false,' and remove all false ones.  

Create simple stmt that tells us it’s a loop of reports or objwf instead of that big section I had to manually add. Have it convert automatically
 
create file that has list of all files (except index)?  if it matches one of the array lists then it identifies that folder type?

folder name can identify folder type? report? objwf? form? set those as 'none' and make others default of namespace?


authContext.js should be authContext.tsx. stop converting .js to .gen.js. create suppress extension substitution tag?

react demo app instead of static html

remove {/*[any number of spaces or newlines]*/}

reverse template tag substitution: 
create separate replacement dictionary until full file is processed
put tags like |*[replacement tag array index number]*| in file
pass around tag array in tempalte creation code
add step at end to impement tag array
after this, sort on property by property name siz not relevant. 
sort on property value length is relevant

remove IsConditionalVisible prop. its not used. a calculated one is instead

Analytics…
Need… Api key, page , context code
Model feature?
Root Top level setting ?
Send to queue. No db write
All go to one endpoint


Cache api keys? To redis? Mem cache?
